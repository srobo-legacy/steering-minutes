Minutes:

In responce to Hills Road broken USB port: 

We will Replace board. 
Probably single failure currently. If it happens to another team we need to get on it. 

There should be a note with the next one: 
"Don't plug the usb back in if it breaks again."

Ask if they will be at a tech day to return the broken board or we will pay for shipping as its probably manufacturing fault and not due to them doing something bad. 



First movement Award: 

SC decided to make it now a "Rookie award" and only schools that have not competed before can win. 

SC decided that we shall change it for this year, because no one has officially won the award yet due to it being only once it has been posted on the forums, which are not up.

Redacted from public view - discussion on a single team events. Version can be aquired from 2012-2013 committee with reason. 

New Award:

Rookie award, for the highest new team in the league.

Gives new teams something to go for, even if they don't have the experience to win, they still could go away with something. 


Redacted from public view - as stated above. 


Kit Allocation: 


Lilafisc has two/three teams in germany. 

Three (second kits) to PSC, HLS and headington. 

Wait till Thursday to see if lilafisc third team, then allocate accordingly.  

Give the new Kent school a team. 


Sponsorship: 


Do we want more?
We are okay for the next year, but after this we will need more funding. 
Hopefully ARM will be providing some, Rob is in talks with them. 
However it is not urgent as of yet. 

Small chance of TI as well, but this is unlikely. 



Next committee meeting to be around Christmas, before or after.
