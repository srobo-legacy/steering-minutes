If there was nothing do to, that'd be fine. But there's lots to do after they come back.
Testing. Construction. Wrong with them all -- horrible issues. 
Most optimistic time would be 10 days of stuff. 

Delaying shipment of kit - not agree. 
Can we ship dev kit temporarily? if we don't ship at kickstart it takes a long time. 
we need dev kit. 

We can have 36 teams if we start two of three weeks later. 

Competition should not will move back and will not move back.

Disadvantages to moving competition back:

Small chance of schools losing interest. 

Advantages: 
!We will have kit!
We could have more time to recruit. 
Schools have longer to find a team. 

24 teams almost signed up. Some want two teams, we could get 36. 

Moving kickstart back to multiple dates:
Currently booked it on saturday. Sunday potentially. Weekdays nope.

All agreed on: 

27th October - 1st priority
28th October - 3rd
3rd November - 2nd priority
4th November - 4th. 

Two weeks to kickstart, only one treasurer to ack purchases. 

You have to convince Jeremy that teams exist if you want them comfirmed early.

Sponsor interaction, Bristol Union can't fund all travel, srobo will, also will try to see who potential sponsor is. 

Continue of talk about recruitment of schools.
