present: all

Charity:

This will go out in a mail this week.

Smallpeice:
lilafisch will talk to David Oakley,
if we do it we will do it with the new kit.

January big weekend doing:
lilafisch proposed to have a get together of blueshirts
from everywhere in one place.
The purpose of this would be to do things together,
have talks about sr topics, get to know each other.
There is a financial issue, 
we currently don't have budget to supply travel cost.
One idea is that we might try and share the travel cost
amongst all blueshirts.

This was generally well taken,
people are invited to hand in ideas to lilafisch
and one person in each branch will interact with
her to do things locally.
